I started doing these in Dec 2020, and with awk, it was awesome! And very compact on the first few days.
As the month went on, awk became more and more cumbersome, but I stuck with it.  Writing graph traversals
and topological sorting in awk was an interesting exercise.

Over time, though, python emerges as the most supple, easiest, and convenient language for this.  Manipulating
strings, grids, arrays, and tuples is what we need.
